Aircrack
Description:
    Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security.

It focuses on different areas of WiFi security:

Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools
Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection
Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection)
Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2)
All tools are command line which allows for heavy scripting. A lot of GUIs have taken advantage of this feature. It works primarily on Linux but also Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, as well as Solaris and even eComStation 2.


Aircrack NG is designed for cracking flaws within wireless connections by capturing data packets for an effective protocol in exporting through text files for analysis. While the software seemed abandoned in 2010, Aircrack was updated again in 2019.

This tool is supported on various OS and platforms with support for WEP dictionary attacks. It offers an improved tracking speed compared to most other penetration tools and supports multiple cards and drivers. After capturing the WPA handshake, the suite is capable of using a password dictionary and statistical techniques to break into WEP.

Benefits:

Works with Linux, Windows, OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris.
You can use this tool to capture packets and export data.
It is designed for testing wifi devices as well as driver capabilities.
Focuses on different areas of security, such as attacking, monitoring, testing, and cracking.
In terms of attacking, you can perform de-authentication, establish fake access points, and perform replay attacks
